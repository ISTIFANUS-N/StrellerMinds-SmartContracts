# Proxy Contract

## Overview
An upgradeable proxy contract for Stellar smart contracts using Soroban. Allows contract implementation updates while maintaining the same address, with built-in rollback capabilities.

## Core Functions
```rust
// Initialize proxy (one-time only)
fn initialize(env: Env, admin: Address, implementation: Address)

// Upgrade to new implementation (admin only)
fn upgrade(env: Env, new_implementation: Address)

// Rollback to previous implementation (admin only)
fn rollback(env: Env)

// View functions
fn get_implementation(env: Env) -> Address
fn get_admin(env: Env) -> Address
Quick Start
Testing
bash# Run all tests
cargo test --package proxy

# Run specific test
cargo test --package proxy test_cannot_reinitialize

# With output
cargo test --package proxy -- --nocapture
Usage Example
rust// Initialize
let admin = Address::generate(&env);
let implementation = Address::generate(&env);
client.initialize(&admin, &implementation);

// Upgrade
let new_impl = Address::generate(&env);
client.upgrade(&new_impl);

// Rollback if needed
client.rollback();

What's Tested

✅ Admin-only upgrade/rollback authorization
✅ Re-initialization prevention
✅ Storage isolation across upgrades
✅ Rollback stack integrity
✅ Multiple upgrade/rollback scenarios
✅ Edge cases (empty stack, unauthorized access)

Security Considerations
🔴 Critical Risks

Admin Key Compromise → Attacker controls all upgrades

Mitigation: Use multi-sig wallet, hardware security modules


Malicious Upgrades → Complete contract takeover

Mitigation: Audit all implementations, use timelock (future)


Storage Incompatibility → Data corruption

Mitigation: Never reorder storage variables (see below)


Re-initialization → Admin takeover

Status: ✅ Protected by built-in guards



✅ Storage Compatibility Rules
❌ WRONG - Don't reorder variables:
rust// Version 1
struct State {
    field_a: u64,
    field_b: Address,
}

// Version 2 - BREAKS EVERYTHING!
struct State {
    field_b: Address,  // ❌ Moved position
    field_a: u64,      // ❌ Moved position
}
✅ CORRECT - Only append new fields:
rust// Version 1
struct State {
    field_a: u64,
    field_b: Address,
}

// Version 2 - Safe
struct State {
    field_a: u64,      // ✅ Same position
    field_b: Address,  // ✅ Same position
    field_c: String,   // ✅ New field at end
}
Deployment Checklist
Before Production

 All tests passing (cargo test --package proxy)
 Security audit completed
 Multi-sig admin wallet configured
 Testnet deployment successful
 Upgrade/rollback tested end-to-end
 Monitoring and alerts configured
 Emergency rollback procedure documented

Deployment Steps
bash# 1. Deploy proxy
stellar contract deploy --wasm proxy.wasm

# 2. Deploy implementation
stellar contract deploy --wasm implementation.wasm

# 3. Initialize proxy
stellar contract invoke --id PROXY_ID \
  --fn initialize \
  --arg ADMIN_ADDRESS \
  --arg IMPL_ADDRESS

# 4. Verify
stellar contract invoke --id PROXY_ID --fn get_implementation
Upgrade Patterns
Standard Upgrade
Deploy new impl → Audit → Test on testnet → Upgrade mainnet → Monitor → Keep rollback ready
Emergency Rollback
Detect issue → Call rollback() → Notify users → Fix offline → Re-upgrade
Key Features
✅ Re-initialization Protected - Cannot be re-initialized after first setup
✅ Admin-Only Operations - All upgrades require admin authorization
✅ Rollback Stack - Maintains history for multiple rollbacks
✅ Event Logging - Emits events for all state changes
✅ Comprehensive Tests - 30+ tests covering all scenarios
Events

proxy_initialized - Proxy setup complete
proxy_upgraded - Implementation changed
proxy_rollback - Reverted to previous implementation

Limitations & Roadmap
Current Limitations

⚠️ No timelock (upgrades instant)
⚠️ Single admin only (use multi-sig wallet)
⚠️ No pause mechanism
⚠️ Limited rollback history

Future Enhancements

 Timelock mechanism
 Multi-signature admin support
 Emergency pause functionality
 On-chain governance
 Extended rollback history

Common Issues
Q: Admin lost keys?
A: Cannot upgrade/rollback. Use multi-sig in production.
Q: Upgrade failed?
A: Call rollback() immediately to revert.
Q: Multiple rollbacks possible?
A: Yes, up to storage limits.
Q: Can admin be changed?
A: Not in current version. Feature can be added if needed.
Integration Examples
Frontend (JavaScript)
javascriptconst proxy = new Contract(PROXY_ADDRESS);

// Use normally - calls forward to current implementation
await proxy.yourFunction(args);

// Listen for upgrades
proxy.on('proxy_upgraded', (event) => {
    console.log('Upgraded to:', event.new_implementation);
});
Smart Contract
rust// Always maintain storage layout compatibility
#[contracttype]
pub struct StateV2 {
    pub existing_field: u64,    // ✅ Keep same
    pub new_field: Option<i128>, // ✅ Add at end only
}
Important Notes
⚠️ Soroban Host Delegation: Actual call forwarding handled by Soroban host, not userland Rust
⚠️ Audit Before Upgrade: Always audit new implementations
⚠️ Test on Testnet: Never upgrade mainnet without testing
⚠️ Monitor Events: Set up alerts for unauthorized actions
⚠️ Document Changes: Keep upgrade history off-chain
